<p>Wind Dynamics in Unity

    Helin Saeid & Edvin Hedenström
    
    
    Background:
    Wind is a common occurrence in video games, with games like Red Dead Redemption (Walia, 2023),  The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds having wind elements affect the conditions of the game (Alpan, 2024). A small study on realism in games showed that, among various elements from the physical world, wind simulation contributes to the overall sense of realism. (Alpan, 2024) We would therefore like to explore the effects of adding wind to our existing scene from the lab and also implement the effect of wind strength in the area on the primary bullets shot by our tank.
    
    Objective:
    To enhance the existing tank shooting game in Unity by implementing wind dynamics, which will affect the trajectory of bullets fired by the player's tank. We are aiming for an E-D grade. 
    
    Features:
    Implement a wind system that generates random or predefined wind vectors in the game environment.
    Wind should have variable strength and direction, affecting bullet trajectory accordingly.
    Wind should be visible to the player, either through visual indicators like blowing particles or by affecting objects in the environment.
    
    Implementation:
    Utilize Unity's physics engine to simulate wind dynamics.
    Implement wind as a global environmental factor that affects all objects in the scene, including bullets and enemy tanks.
    Use Unity's Rigidbody physics components to calculate bullet trajectories.
    Integrate wind force calculations into the bullet's movement script to adjust trajectory during flight.
