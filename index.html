<h1> Wind particles in scene </h1>
  <p> Today we implemented particle systems in our scene to vizualise the winds in the game. We took inspiriation from the winds in the game The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Since we had a clear vision it was quite easy to implement. We have created several winds and spread them across the scene. They vary in 2 motions. Next step is to create 2 zones where the winds differ in direction and strength.</p>

<h1> First day working on project </h1>
  <p> Today we created a windzone in our unity file that we are planning to create random windstreams that blow across, right now we just added a script to every bullet shot where we add a constant force to mimic wind. It works as of now, took some time and some struggles with most of them being Edvin's (this is Edvin writing by the way) inability to spell the word "Behaviour". Also just not using Vector3 in the wrong place when creating the Vector. Whoops. Once that was figured out it works perfectly now, our plan is to create the wind particle effects first and then create randomized vector sizes after that is done :).</p>
  
<h1>Project Specification</h1>
<p> Wind Dynamics in Unity</p>

<p>Helin Saeid &amp; Edvin Hedenstr&ouml;m</p>

<p> Background: Wind is a common occurrence in video games, with games like Red Dead Redemption (Walia, 2023), The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and PlayerUnknown&rsquo;s Battlegrounds having wind elements affect the conditions of the game (Alpan, 2024). A small study on realism in games showed that, among various elements from the physical world, wind simulation contributes to the overall sense of realism. (Alpan, 2024) We would therefore like to explore the effects of adding wind to our existing scene from the lab and also implement the effect of wind strength in the area on the primary bullets shot by our tank.</p>

<p>Objective: To enhance the existing tank shooting game in Unity by implementing wind dynamics, which will affect the trajectory of bullets fired by the player's tank. We are aiming for an E-D grade.</p>

<p>Features: Implement a wind system that generates random or predefined wind vectors in the game environment. Wind should have variable strength and direction, affecting bullet trajectory accordingly. Wind should be visible to the player, either through visual indicators like blowing particles or by affecting objects in the environment.</p>
<p>Implementation: Utilize Unity's physics engine to simulate wind dynamics. Implement wind as a global environmental factor that affects all objects in the scene, including bullets and enemy tanks. Use Unity's Rigidbody physics components to calculate bullet trajectories. Integrate wind force calculations into the bullet's movement script to adjust trajectory during flight.</p>
